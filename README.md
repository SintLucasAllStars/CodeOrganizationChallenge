sooooooooooo yeah this was an attempt to make the game Evolution in 1 day basicly
* so the main point is that we learned quit alot during this time
* our team was me (ertugrul(eddie)) and jesper
* https://youtu.be/k4V3Mo61fJM?t=11s this how we felt after a whole day of non stop coding

### Evolution
A system to manage an evoutionary simulation.
* Little creatures have DNA, Their DNA defines their shape, type and behaviour (How they move through the world and what happens when they meet other creatures).
* It should be as easy as possible for a programmer to create/add new creatures to the game.
* When two creatures meet they can fight or mate.
* If they fight, one of them will die.
* If they mate then a new creature will appear that is a combination of their DNA.
* Each simulation has a World and a set of initial creatures.
* The world has obstacles and food. All Creatures can detect food when they get close enough to it. What they do about it depends on their DNA.

## The deadline
All pull requests should be sent before the end of Friday the 2nd of February 2018.
