###about the project

differnt behavior for example
	*eating
	*fighting
	*mating
****
###our aim for the game

* Little creatures have DNA, Their DNA defines their shape, type and behaviour (How they move through the world and what happens when they meet other creatures).
* It should be as easy as possible for a programmer to create/add new creatures to the game.
* When two creatures meet they can fight or mate.
* If they fight, one of them will die.
* If they mate then a new creature will appear that is a combination of their DNA.
* Each simulation has a World and a set of initial creatures.
* The world has obstacles and food. All Creatures can detect food when they get close enough to it. What they do about it depends on their DNA.**
